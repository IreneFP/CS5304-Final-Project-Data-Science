# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
CS5304 Data Science in the Wild

By Jack Rossi, Ryan Gale, Aayushi Jain & Irene Font Peradejordi 

We participated in the Kaggle disaster tweets competition <https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started> and built a twitter screening tool with a deep neural averaging network. The model folder contains a demo interface for classifying user entered tweets as disaster or not, as well as ipynb scripts showing our modelling approach.
